This repository contains the data for the Zambian Legislative Summarization project. The project focuses on automatically summarizing acts of parliament from Zambia. The data consists of both the raw data collected from the Zambian National Assembly website and the processed data obtained from the raw data.

The raw directory contains the raw data collected from the Zambian National Assembly website. These files are in pdf format and represent the original legislative acts as obtained from the official source.

The processed directory contains the processed data obtained from the raw data. These files are in plain text format (TXT) and have undergone text extraction and cleaning processes. The text extraction involves extracting the relevant content from the raw data files, while the cleaning process removes unnecessary formatting and ensures a clean and readable format for further analysis.

Feel free to reach out to us if you need any further information or assistance regarding the data part of the project.
