    The preprocessing directory contains modules for text extraction and cleaning. These modules are responsible for extracting the text content from the legislative acts and performing necessary cleaning operations such as removing unwanted characters or formatting.

    The feature_extraction directory includes modules for feature extraction. These modules extract relevant features from the preprocessed text, such as keywords or sentence embeddings, which can be used as input for summarization models.

    The modeling directory holds modules related to summarization modeling. This includes both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques implemented in extractive_summarization.py and abstractive_summarization.py, respectively.

    The evaluation directory contains modules for evaluating the quality of the generated summaries. For example, the rouge_scores.py module calculates the ROUGE scores, a popular metric for summarization evaluation.
