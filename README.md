Project Name: Zambian Legislative Document Summarization

Description: This project aims to create a model that can summarize Zambian legislative documents to be specific acts of parliaments. The model will be trained on a dataset of Zambian legislative documents, and it will be able to extract the key information from these documents and summarize it in a concise and informative way.

This is the main folder and it contains repositories that were used for this project:

    legislation-dataset: This repository contains the dataset of Zambian legislative documents that will be used to train the model.
    legislation-model: This repository contains the code for the model that will be used to summarize the legislative documents.
    legislation-web-app: This repository contains the code for the web app that will be used to interact with the model.

Please refer to the individual files and directories for more specific information and usage guidelines.

This project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for summarizing Zambian legislative documents.
